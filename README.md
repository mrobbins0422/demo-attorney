# object-fit

A landing page using object-fit on the background image.  

## Purpose

I had a graphic that I wanted to use on a landing page for an attorney website. 
I wanted to take advantage of the open space in the graphic to hold the content
and let the background clip for the different view ports.  

After trying numerous combinations of loading the image via HTML or CSS as an
image or as a background, I decided to load the image in HTML and use it as a 
background for my grid.

## Current Project Status

The basic design is solid.

I want to tweak the blue highlight under the names using calc so it always 
has the same right offset.
